                  Turbo Pascal 7 Help Compiler Instructions
                 -------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

I am writing an SVGA graphics library (soon to be released), and I wanted to
create the ultimate documentation for it... On-line help!  So I looked around
for something to create a .TPH file, but found nothing I liked.

So with some information of the .TPH file format (from `Borland Open
Architecture Handbook for Pascal' pages 170-177), I set about writing a
program to write one.  This is the final result of my toiling!

Inluding in this ZIP file is the main help file compiler (TPHC.EXE), an
interface program for the IDE (TPHC2MSG.EXE) and an index list generator
(GENINDEX.EXE).  To help with your creation of a .TPH file, I have included
the original text file used to create the .TPH file for the graphics library
(TG.TXT).

I require no payment for the use of this program or for the distribution of
help files created using this program, it is supplied as is, without any
restrictions.

Of course, like everyone, any payments made to me are greatly appreciated,
but is completely optional, e-mail, or any other type of acknowledgement of
the use of this program is also appreciated (postcards seem to be quite
common!).

                 -------------------------------------------

Installing
----------

You can put this program where ever you like, I would suggest the "bin"
directory where the compiler itself is located, or you could make another
directory.  Ideally, the program should be located in a location specified
in your path statement.

                 -------------------------------------------

Making TPHC and GenIndex a Tool in the IDE
------------------------------------------

After the file has been unzipped, start your IDE.  Select the Options/Tools
menu item, press New.  The entries are:

Title: ~T~PH Compiler
Program path: TPHC      (you may have to specify the full path)
Command line: $EDNAME $NOSWAP $CAP MSG(TPHC2MSG) $SAVE ALL

I use the Shift-F8 hotkey, but you can choose that.

Press Ok.

Now, to add the GenIndex program, make a new tool, the entries are:

Title: TPH ~I~ndexer
Program path: GENINDEX
Command line: $EDNAME $NOSWAP $SAVE ALL $CAP EDIT

I use the Shift-F7 hotkey.

Press Ok.

That is all that is required for installing the program.

                 -------------------------------------------

Using TPHC
----------

From within the IDE, make sure the active window is the text file that you
want to compile, and then simply select the TPH Compiler tool from the
Tools menu (or the hot-key).

The Message window will pop up showing the results of compilation.  In an
ideal situation, there should be only one or two messages:

  Successfully opened output file <name>
  Description found <description>

If there are more, they are error messages (more info later).


From the command line, execute by: TPHC <name>

The same info is shown as in the message window.

                 -------------------------------------------

Using GenIndex
--------------

GenIndex is a simple utility that reads a text file and generates a list
of all the context numbers in the file and the line following the context
number statement.

The output of the program can be used to quickly generate an index (but
reformatting is required).

                 -------------------------------------------

Installing a TPH file in the IDE
--------------------------------

To add a .TPH file to the on-line help in the IDE, select the Help/Files
menu item, and add the .TPH file to include.

                 -------------------------------------------

Writing a Text File to make a TPH File
--------------------------------------


The first line must contain the output file (TPHC is case-insensitve)...

%OUTFILE <file>.TPH

This is the name of the final .TPH file that is generated.


Next, an optional description can be added...

%DESCRIPTION <description>

This is used when there are index entries with the same name, the
description is used to determine which file to use.  It may not be apparent
what I just said, but for an example, compile the TG.TXT, add it to the
on-line help in the IDE (see above), press Shift-F1 and type "GetPixel".
There you will see what the description does.


Contexts, a help page, are now added...

Each context is identified by a number, this number can be anything you
choose.  This number is also used for cross references in a context.

The start of each context is specified by: %<context>

The first three contexts are special...

The first context (%0 in TG.TXT) is a blank context that can never be
accessed.

The second context is something I cannot explain!  It is suggested to leave
it blank like the first.

The third context (%3 in TG.TXT) is the main contents context, it is the
first screen shown when using the .TPH from THelp.COM.

All other contexts can now be added to make your .TPH file.


To make a cross reference in a context, surround the context label (the
text that is highlighted) in a ~ character, followed by a colon then the
context number, for example, ~text~:10.

A character may follow the context number immediately.


Another thing you can do is highlight text like sample code, the character
to activate/deactivate this highlight, press Ctrl-U to get a  character.
(This works in the TP/BP IDE, but may not work in other editors.)


After all the context entries have been added, the index entry has to be
added.

The line to start the index is: %INDEX

The index entry text is specified (no spaces), then the context number.
There can be several index entries that point to the same context
(such as the CRT colours in the standard help file).

The order does not have to be alphabetical, it is sorted by the TPH compiler.


The last line in the help file is: %END

Anything following %END is ignored (can be used for anything!)


See TG.TXT for a complete example of making a .TPH file.

Error Messages
--------------

Input file was not specified

  The input text file (the command line arguement) was not specifed.


Fatal Error: Cannot find input file <file>

  The input text file that was specified could not be found.


Fatal Error: Cannot find output file name

  The %OUTFILE statement was not found on the first line.


Fatal Error: Cannot open output file <file>

  The file specified by %OUTFILE could not be created.


Successfully opened output file <file>

  This is not an error, this specifies the .TPH file that is being created.


Description found <description>

  This is not an error, but states the .TPH description used in the index.


Duplicate Context label found <number>

  A previous context has already been defined with the specified number.
  A different number has to be chosen for one of the contexts.


Invalid Context label or Command <statement>

  A % character was the first character on the line, and the rest of the
  line was not a recognized statement or number.  The only accepted
  statements are %OUTFILE, %DESCRIPTION, %INDEX, %END and %0 to %65535.


Invalid Context label in Index list <entry>

  A non-numerical entry was specified after the index label.  No spaces
  can be used in an index entry label.


Context label in index doesn't exist <entry>

  A context number in the index section has not been previously defined.


Unexpected end of file, should end with %END

  The end of the file was reached without a %END statement being found.
  A %END should be the last line in the text file.


Fatal Error: Index Table was not found

  An index table was not found, one must be added (following a %INDEX).


Context label not found after keyword <line>

  A word(s) was highlighted with a ~ character but no context number was
  specified after the ~ (after a colon).
  If a ~ character is wanted in the text, you should use ~~.


End of Keyword not found <line>

  A ~ was in the text file, but a matching one was not found in the line.
